I am Barry Branham.  I started developing software for Caradiothoracic Surgery Research at Duke University in Sept. 1980.  In 1983 the doctor I worked for (Dr. Janes Cox) transfered to St. Louis to become chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Washington Univesity.  I went with him to set up his lab there.  I retired in 2020.

The software consists of 4 main programs:
Getpic3 - for creating 3d heart models from CT or MRI images.
Dash - for running a/d converters to aquire electrogram data from a heart.
Glas - (Get Look Analyze Save) for displaying 2d electrogram data.
Map3 - uses the 3d heart models to display activation data dynamically (movies) on the 3D heart models from Getpic3.

The software for these programs is organized in several librarys in 'src/libs'.
